# Woocommerce-Combine-Orders
 - PHP Function with two input fields for Order IDs and a button to combine those orders in Woocommerce Admin Order List Page.
 - Please check the example.png to see how it works step by step. (Open image in a new tab to see properly)
 - Code goes to functions.php of your theme or child theme.

---

### To-Do: 
- Current code adds a product A from Order X to Order Y as an individual. When Order Y has product A too, only the quantity of it should change, but code adds another product A separately for now.
- Add another button to combine selected user's processing orders.
